Module execution:
	Module can be executed from analysis/001/, by any of the following commands:

	1) `mk <SPECIFIC_TARGET>`; where SPECIFIC_TARGET is any line printed by `001/bin/targets`.

	2) `bin/targets | xrags mk`; every posible target printed by 001/bin/targets will be generated in tandem.

	3) `condor submit`; parallel generation of every posible target printed by 001/bin/targets. Needs HTCondor to run.

Expected output:
	EXAMPLE:

	Intermediate files:
	results/
	├── SM-3MG3L_chr22.markdup.intervals

	Requested output:
	results/
	├── SAMPLE.ir.rtc.bam		##Indel-realigned bam file
	├── SAMPLE.ir.rtc.bam.bai	##Index for Indel-realigned bam file

Module description:
	This module takes an input BAM, the it locally realign reads such that the number of mismatching bases is minimized across all the reads. 
	This step is important because BWA-like algorithms penalice more indels than mismatches producing bias generating a lot of mismatches where INDELs are supossed to be.

	There are 2 steps to the realignment process:

	1) Determining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment (RealignerTargetCreator tool).
	2) Running the realigner over those intervals (IndelRealigner) using smith waterman algorithm.

	The indel realigment step, can take a reference of INDEL positions in the 1000G-Project in order to detect sites that are more propense to be realigned.

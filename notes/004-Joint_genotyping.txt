Module execution:
        Module can be executed from analysis/001/, by any of the following commands:

        1) `mk <SPECIFIC_TARGET>`; where SPECIFIC_TARGET is any line printed by `004/bin/targets`.

        2) `bin/targets | xrags mk`; every posible target printed by 004/bin/targets will be generated in tandem.

        3) `condor submit`; parallel generation of every posible target printed by 004/bin/targets. Needs HTCondor to run.

Expected output:
        EXAMPLE:

        Requested output:
        results/
	├── Llamado-conjunto_raw.vcf		##Multi-sample vcf file.
	└── Llamado-conjunto_raw.vcf.idx	##Index for multi-sample vcf file

Module description:
	This module takes many gVCFs to pergorm a group genotyping, an important step to detect variants in samples that could have low sequencing-depth, taking into account the information in other input samples.
	This tool will combine all spanning records (samples) to produce correct genotype likelihoods, and re-genotype the newly merged record.

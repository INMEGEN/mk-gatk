Module execution:
        Module can be executed from analysis/001/, by any of the following commands:

        1) `mk <SPECIFIC_TARGET>`; where SPECIFIC_TARGET is any line printed by `005b/bin/targets`.

        2) `bin/targets | xrags mk`; every posible target printed by 005b/bin/targets will be generated in tandem.

        3) `condor submit`; parallel generation of every posible target printed by 005b/bin/targets. Needs HTCondor to run.

Expected output:
        TO-DO
        EXAMPLE:
        Intermediate files:
        results/
	├── SAMPLE.indel.vcf		##vcf with only indels
	├── SAMPLE.indel.vcf.idx	##Index for vcf
	├── SAMPLE.snp.vcf		##vcf with only SNV
	└── SAMPLE.snp.vcf.idx		##Index for vcf

	Requested output:
        results/
	├── SAMPLE.hard_filtered.vcf.gz		##vcf file only with variants passing hard filter
	├── SAMPLE.hard_filtered.vcf.gz.tbi	##Index for vcf file
	├── SAMPLE.filtered.vcf			##vcf file with all variants flagged by hard filtering (includes varianst passing and failing the filter)
	├── SAMPLE.filtered.vcf.idx		##Index for vcf file

Module description:
	This module applies hard filters to a variant callset that is too small for VQSR or for which truth/training sets are not available. Variants are filtered using parameters recommended by the Broad Institute best practices.
